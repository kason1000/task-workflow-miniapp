- Fixed API service to use correct parameter name: changed from sending `limit` to `pageSize` to match backend expectations
- Resolved the issue where the default "All" view showed no tasks by correcting the API parameter mismatch
- Simplified the TaskList component back to non-paginated approach while maintaining all essential features
- Deployed version 1.1.0177 with all functionality working correctly: filters, archive view, group filtering, image viewer, send to chat
- Backend now properly recognizes API calls and returns appropriate task lists based on filters
